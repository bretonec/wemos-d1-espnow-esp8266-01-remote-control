# wemos-d1-espnow-esp8266-01-remote-control
Controllers for raspberry pi mpd music server. Ideal for control of raspberry pi fm transmitter on larger garden party. This was possible because of cifertech, random nerd, edgemicrotech 
and other great people from our great online diy community. Thank you. We don't know each other, but our work is connecting us. 

What we will nead:
- raspberry pi with node-red installed
- wemos d1
- esp8266-02 2x
- usb serial programmer 2x
- nokia 5110
- i2c gpio expander board
- 4x4 matrix keypad
- 2x 18650 batteries
- battery holder
- arduino sensor shield

Easies way is to use first usb serial adapter with esp8266-01 in usb port of raspi and second in usb port of android phone. I like android app - USB Serial Monitor made by Keuwlsoft. But wemos remote is also good.
